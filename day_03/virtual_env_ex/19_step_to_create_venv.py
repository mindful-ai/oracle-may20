Step #1:
Create a virtual environment called oracle

C:\Users\Purushotham\>python -m venv oracle


Step #2:
The above step would create a folder called oracle
in C:\Users\Purushotham\

In order to activate the virtual environment

C:\Users\Purushotham\>oracle\Scripts\activate.bat (Windows)

source oracle\Scripts\activate (Linux)

The above command will lead to the activation of the virtual
environment. The prompt now looks like this:

(oracle) C:\Users\Purushotham>

Step #3:
To come out of the virtual environment just say deactivate
on the command prompt
